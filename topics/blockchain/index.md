A blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. Benefits of adopting blockchain technology are a distributed database, lower costs transparent, and decentralization. It cannot be corrupted: altering any unit of information on the blockchain would mean using a huge amount of computing power to override the entire network.
