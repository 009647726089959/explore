### Editing an existing topic or collection

I'm suggesting these edits to an existing topic or collection:

Please explain why these changes are necessary:


### Curating a new topic or collection

- [ ] I've formatted my changes as a new folder directory, named for the topic or collection as it appears in the URL on GitHub (e.g. `https://github.com/topics/[NAME]` or `https://github.com/collections/[NAME]`)
- [ ] My folder contains a `*.png` image (if applicable) and `index.md`
- [ ] All required fields in my `index.md` conform to the Style Guide and API docs: https://github.com/github/explore/tree/master/docs
