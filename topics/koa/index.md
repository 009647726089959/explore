Koa is a new web framework designed by the team behind Express,
which aims to be a smaller, more expressive, and more robust foundation
for web applications and APIs. Through leveraging generators Koa allows you
to ditch callbacks and greatly increase error-handling. Koa does not bundle any
middleware within core, and provides an elegant suite of methods that make
writing servers fast and enjoyable.
