SpaceVim is a distribution of the vim editor that's inspired by
[spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs). SpaceVim manages collections
of plugins in layers, which help collect related packages together to provide
features. This approach helps keep configuration organized and reduces overhead
for the user by keeping them from having to think about what packages to install.
