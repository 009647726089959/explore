# Contributing

Hi there! We're excited you've got ideas for an existing or new Topic page. Your help makes Explore valuable to others in your community.

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

There are a few ways you can contribute: improving an existing Topic page, or curating a new Topic page.

As you write content, check out the [Style Guide](./docs/styleguide.md) to learn what each field means, and how they should be formatted. Following the style guide will improve the chances of your contribution being accepted.

## Improving an existing Topic page

If a Topic page already exists, it will be listed in the [topics directory](https://github.com/github/explore/tree/master/topics). The topic name should match its URL, e.g. `https://github.com/topics/rails` corresponds to the [`rails` folder](https://github.com/github/explore/tree/master/topics/rails).

To improve an existing Topic page, please **open a pull request** with your proposed changes:

* To update the image, replace the image inside the topic's folder
* To update the content, edit the `index.md` inside the topic's folder

The [pull request template](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) provides guidance on the information you need to include.

**Please fill out the pull request template completely.** If you do not fill out the template, your PR will be closed.

## Curating a new Topic page

If a Topic page is not yet curated, it will NOT be listed in the [topics directory](https://github.com/github/explore/tree/master/topics). The default layout on `https://github.com/topics/foo` looks like this:

![topic page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1840802/30932236-c9c397d2-a37b-11e7-94be-5c9847ea2d71.png)

We are likely to consider suggestions to curate a Topic page that is valuable to GitHub's community. Valuable topics include those that are already [widely used by repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/classifying-your-repository-with-topics/), or a topic that currently lacks important information.

Please note that all suggestions must adhere to GitHub's [Community Guidelines](https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/) and [Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/).

To propose a new Topic page, please **open an pull request** with your proposed changes. The [API docs](./docs/API.md) and [style guide](./docs/styleguide.md) provide guidance on the information you need to include and how it should be formatted.

**Please fill out the pull request template completely.** If you do not fill out the template, your issue will be closed.
