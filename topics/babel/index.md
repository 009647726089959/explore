üê† Babel is a compiler for writing next generation JavaScript. Babel has support for the latest version of JavaScript through syntax transformers. These plugins allow you to use new syntax, right now without waiting for browser support. Babel can also convert JSX syntax and strip out type annotations. Babel is built out of plugins. Compose your own transformation pipeline using existing plugins or write your own.
