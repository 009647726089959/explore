The Xamarin platform consists of a number of elements that allow you to develop applications for iOS and Android:

 • C# language – Allows you to use a familiar syntax and sophisticated features like Generics, LINQ and the Parallel Task Library.  
 • Mono .NET framework – Provides a cross-platform implementation of the extensive features in Microsoft’s .NET framework.  
 • Compiler – Depending on the platform, produces a native app (eg. iOS) or an integrated .NET application and runtime (eg. Android). The compiler also performs many optimizations for mobile deployment such as linking away un-used code.  
 • IDE tools – The Visual Studio on Mac and Windows allows you to create, build, and deploy Xamarin projects.  

In addition, because the underlying language is C# with the .NET framework, projects can be structured to share code that can also be deployed to Windows Phone.
