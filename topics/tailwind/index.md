A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development written in PostCSS and configured through JavaScript, which means it’s highly customizable by design. It doesn’t have a default theme and nor built-in UI components but this also means it has no opinion about how your site should look and doesn’t impose design decisions that you have to fight to undo.
