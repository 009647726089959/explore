A cryptocurrency is a digital currency that only has value dependent on those who back it. For security, cryptocurrencies rely on blockchaining: a database organized in such a way that records are kept secure through peer-to-peer networks. Each record is kept within a block, and each block holds a timestamp and link to the block before it. The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, implemented in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto.
